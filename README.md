# RISC-V

## Product based skilling workshop provided by VLSI System Design Corporation

### Week-0

- Setting up Github and creating a repo with public access.
- Installing VDI file in Oracle VirtualBox.
- **Godbolt** a web-based platform designed to explore and understand the assembly output of various programming languages and compilers.

### Week-1

- Understand binary arithmetic operations in signed, 1's and 2's complement form.
- Design 4-bit ALU in C programming language and verify it using gcc compiler.
- Design the same above ALU in verilog and verify it using iverilog and gtkwave.

### Week-2

- Verify all the c code (counter, matrix multiplication, ALU code) using RISC-V compiler and spike output.
- Measure CPU performance of all the programs mentioned above using either godbolt or RISC-V disassembler.

### Week-3

- Choose RISC-V IoT Application.
- Create block diagram and flowchart for the application.
