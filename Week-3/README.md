# AC Remote Control Signal Reader
This application is developed to read digital signals from AC remote control using IR receiver sensors and then record th ON and OFF signals and store them. The new signal read from the receiver is now compared with the previous input and display if they are same.

### I/O Mapping
#### GPIO mapping
- X30[0] --> IR receiver input pin.
- X30[1] --> Output pin for LED display. 
### IR Receiver
An infrared (IR) receiver is a device used to detect and decode infrared signals transmitted by an IR emitter, commonly used in remote control systems for TVs, air conditioners, and other electronic devices. Here's a detailed description of how an IR receiver functions:

#### Components of an IR Receiver
- **Photodiode or Phototransistor:** The core component that detects IR light. It converts the incoming IR light into an electrical signal.
- **Filter:** Filters out ambient light and only allows IR light of a specific wavelength (typically 940 nm) to pass through.
- **Amplifier:** Amplifies the small electrical signal generated by the photodiode/phototransistor.
- **Demodulator:** Extracts the modulated signal from the carrier wave.
- **Output:** Provides the demodulated signal to the microcontroller or processing unit for further decoding.

Some examples for suitable data format that are accepted by the receiver: 
- NEC Code
- Toshiba Micom Format
- Sharp Code
- RC5 Code
- RC6 Code
- RÂ±2000 Code
- Sony Format (SIRCS).
